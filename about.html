            TATA INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE 2023 REGULATIONS FOR NEWS AND CURRENT
        AFFAIRS BROADCASTERS FOR AUDIO VISUAL BROADCASTING
        I. INTRODUCTION
        A. These TATA Indian Premier League 2023 Regulations For News And Current Affairs
        Broadcasters For Audio Visual Broadcasting (the “Regulations”) are issued in
        relation to the TATA Indian Premier League 2023 (the “Tournament”), and are
        designed to permit and promote broad distribution of news relating to the matches
        comprising the Tournament (the “Matches” and each a “Match”) whilst protecting
        the integrity of the rights licensed to the Official Broadcaster (as defined below) by
        the Board of Control for Cricket in India (“BCCI”).
        B. These Regulations apply solely to broadcasters having channels registered under
        the category of “News and Current Affairs” channels under the Ministry of
        Information and Broadcasting's “Uplinking/Downlinking Guidelines” (“News
        Broadcasters”).
        C. These Regulations have been framed on the basis of well-established fair use
        principles upheld by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in 2012. News Broadcasters may
        use Match footage from the official feed of the Tournament broadcast by the Official
        Broadcaster only within the below specified limits and parameters. Other channels
        which are not News Broadcasters and in particular sports channels or sports
        news/programmes on sports channels are not permitted to use any footage related
        to the Tournament or the Matches.
        D. News Broadcasters shall not be permitted to broadcast, transmit, distribute and/or
        stream any audio-visual or visual-only footage relating to the Tournament or the
        Matches (including all in-stadia events, ceremonies, whether pre-Match, between
        innings or post-Match) anywhere in the world, other than as explicitly permitted
        under these Regulations.
        E. The Official Broadcaster shall permit the transmission of any audio-visual footage
        relating to the Tournament or any Match by News Broadcasters via traditional
        television transmission media such as terrestrial, cable and satellite on linear,
        regularly scheduled news bulletins only. Any other transmission, delivery,
        distribution or streaming of Match footage is prohibited except to the extent and
        manner explicitly permitted in these Regulations. Usage of Match footage by the
        News Broadcasters shall be monitored by and/or on behalf of the Official
        Broadcaster and the BCCI.
